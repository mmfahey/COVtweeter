# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Tweetbot

## Description
Automated data scrapping and analysis of new cases and deaths from COVID-19. The data is obtained from John Hopkins automatically via Linux crontab on a Raspberry Pi and the tweetbot would tweet out daily plots and data tables.

## Project Status
No longer updated or used. The twitter account is still active and can be viewed to get an idea of what the project did.

## Installation
To deploy own twitter bot, must have a twitter developer account to fill in the variables needed in tweeter.py. Also must have python installed with Pandas and matplotlib

## Usage
Once setup, the project is automated so once the user has added their credentials to tweeter.py and setup the crontab to run the data aggregation and tweetbot the project runs itself.
